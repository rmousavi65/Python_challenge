PyBank: Analysis on monthly Profit/Loss data
PyPoll: Analysis on election result


# Background

In this work, I created python scripts for analyzing the financial records of PyBank and the election result of PyPoll.

# PyBank:

In this work, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of PyBank. With a set of financial data called budget_data.csv, the dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
